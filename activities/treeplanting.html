                <h2>Tree planting Together with Girl Scouts</h2>
                <p>The **Tree Planting Activity** organized by the **Sangguniang Kabataan (SK)** in collaboration with the **Girl Scouts of Brgy. Ilosong** is a meaningful environmental initiative aimed at promoting sustainability and fostering a love for nature within the community. The event is set to take place at a designated **venue within Brgy. Ilosong**, such as a local park, vacant lot, or public space that is in need of greening or reforestation. 

                    This activity invites residents, especially the youth and Girl Scouts, to actively participate in planting trees and contributing to the beautification of the barangay. The event not only helps improve the local environment but also instills a sense of responsibility and environmental stewardship among the participants.
                    
                    By working together with the **Girl Scouts**, the SK ensures that the event promotes values of teamwork, community engagement, and a commitment to preserving the environment for future generations. The venue for the tree planting is carefully chosen to ensure that the planted trees have a lasting positive impact, providing shade, improving air quality, and enhancing the overall beauty of Brgy. Ilosong.</p>
