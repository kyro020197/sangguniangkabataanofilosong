                <h2>Youth Profiling</h2>
                <p>The **Youth Profiling of Brgy. Ilosong** is a community-based initiative led by the **Sangguniang Kabataan (SK)** to gather important demographic and personal information about the youth in the barangay. This program aims to create a comprehensive database of young residents aged 15 to 30 years old, which will help the SK and other local government units better understand the needs, interests, and challenges faced by the youth in the community.

                    Through the **Youth Profiling**, the SK collects information on various aspects such as education, skills, employment status, interests, and involvement in community activities. This data will serve as a valuable tool for planning and implementing relevant programs, services, and projects tailored specifically to the youth, such as educational workshops, employment opportunities, sports and recreational activities, health and wellness initiatives, and other youth development programs.
                    
                    The profiling process is typically carried out through surveys, interviews, or online forms, ensuring that every young person in Brgy. Ilosong is given the opportunity to participate. The gathered information will be kept confidential and used only for community development purposes.
                    
                    By conducting the **Youth Profiling**, the **Sangguniang Kabataan** demonstrates its commitment to empowering the youth and ensuring that their voices are heard. The initiative also promotes active youth participation in local governance and allows the barangay to address their specific needs more effectively, ultimately fostering a stronger and more engaged community in Brgy. Ilosong.</p>
